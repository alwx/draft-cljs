## Draft-cljs

This is a hack to use `draft-js` editor with ClojureScript and
without state-related problems.

`draft-cljs` is based on `draft-js-plugins-editor` (https://github.com/draft-js-plugins/draft-js-plugins) since version 2.0.0.

### Installation

`draft-js-plugins-editor`-based version:
```
npm install --save draft-cljs@2
```

`draft-js`-based version:
```
npm install --save draft-cljs@1.0
```
